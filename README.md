## My Nixos configuration (Heavily inspired by [Ampersand](https://github.com/Andrey0189))
---------------
It uses [Niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri) instead of Hyprland.
All configurations files (exclude waybar.nix, wofi.nix) are written by me.


I improved:
- [x] Waybar.nix - added separator and fixed nondeclarative weather script
- [x] Swaybg.nix (original config uses Hyprpaper with Stylix) - it downloads and fetches a picture from imgur and sets it as a wallpaper (works as sysyemd service)
- [x] Flake.nix - removed Stylix (because my config uses niri instead of Hyprland)
- [ ] GTK themes and settings

### UPDATE: I don't use NixOS anymore. I switched to Arch and this repository is just a dead files of my previous configuration.
### BUT!
#### You still can improve it with pull requests, i will be checking it and merging it into the 'community' branch.
